Title:  
Enhancing Human-Machine Collaboration and Trust in Security Operations with Explainable AI in SOAR Platforms.
 
Introduction: Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms are essential for managing security operations. However, they rely on AI, which poses challenges for transparency and trust. This project develops human-centric and explainable AI (XAI) capabilities for SOAR platforms, making automated responses understandable to security analysts.
Why This Project:
Cybersecurity faces a pressing issue: the gap between the demand for security personnel and the human limitations and costs. SOAR platforms can automate tasks and streamline workflows, enhancing security operations. However, they lack transparency in explaining their responses to security analysts. This project integrates XAI techniques into SOAR platforms, fostering understanding and trust between SOAR platforms and security experts. This enhances human-machine collaboration and ensures security analysts can vet SOAR actions. The project aims to provide an ethical, transparent, and effective solution for cybersecurity.
 
Objective: Objective:
The project aims to integrate explainable AI (XAI) techniques into SOAR platforms to enhance collaboration and trust in security operations. Specifically:
1.	Investigate Suitable XAI Techniques: Research and identify XAI methods like LIME and SHAP to explain AI-driven decisions in SOAR platforms.
2.	Develop and Implement Prototypes: Create prototypes integrating XAI techniques into a chosen SOAR platform (e.g., Cortex XSOAR) to provide clear explanations for automated responses.
3.	Conduct User Studies: Evaluate the effectiveness of XAI explanations through user studies involving security analysts, gathering feedback to validate utility and usability.
4.	Assess Impact on Decision-Making Processes: Compare the performance of XAI-integrated SOAR platforms to traditional methods, quantifying benefits in transparency and understanding.
Advantages and Problems Resolved:
•	Enhanced Transparency: Integrating XAI enhances transparency, fostering trust among analysts and improving collaboration.
•	Improved Collaboration: Providing insights into automated responses improves collaboration, leveraging human expertise alongside machines.
•	Streamlined Workflow: Better understanding of automated responses streamlines workflow efficiency, enabling quicker decision-making.
•	Ethical Considerations: Transparent explanations ensure ethical and responsible cybersecurity operations, mitigating risks and consequences.
The project revolutionizes cybersecurity, bridging human-machine gaps, enhancing trust, and reinforcing global security.
